The Scavenger Hunt activity should only take up one session while the time spend on review may take 1-2 sessions.

|Scavenger Hunt | In this session students will first go through a around of ice-breaker activities. They will then pair up to complete a [series of challenges](clues.MD) that will test their skills on topics covered in ScriptEd year 1. | 
|Review| Volunteers may choose to teach some lessons from the [ScriptEd year 1 curriculum](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2016)in order to ensure student mastery on these concepts. This review must not exceed two sessions.|

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* Require students to pair up with someone who is not in their school. Create a community within the class!
* Decide how you are going to keep score before the Scavenger Hunt session. Most teams use a whiteboard.
* Have prizes ready for the scavenger hunt. Candy is a fan-favorite.
* Do not spend more than 2 sessions on the foundations review. Students will need to get into advanced materials at this point.
