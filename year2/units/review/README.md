#Unit: Foundations Course Review 


##Scope
This unit will begin with some ice-breaking activities. It will then ask the students to compete in an activity that will test their knowledge of concepts taught in the first year of ScriptEd. After which, teachers will spend some time covering some foundational skills. The teachers may choose which skills need to be revisited. 

##Estimated Completion Time
The Scavenger Hunt activity should only take up one session while the time spend on review may take 1-2 sessions.  

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* Require students to pair up with someone who is not in their school. Create a community within the class!
* Decide how you are going to keep score before the Scavenger Hunt session. Most teams use a whiteboard.
* Have prizes ready for the scavenger hunt. Candy is a fan-favorite.
* Do not spend more than 2 sessions on the foundations review. Students will need to get into advanced materials at this point.
