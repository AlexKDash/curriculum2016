#Unit Review: Project 1 || Scavenger Hunt


##Scope
The beginning of first session should be allotted for expectations, a company orientation, and icebreakers. Students will then pair up to complete a [series of challenges](clues.md) that will test their skills on topics covered in ScriptEd year 1. 


##Estimated Completion Time
After expectation setting, a company orientation, and icebreakers, the goal should be for students to begin the Scavenger Hunt in session 1.  They come back together in their pairs to complete the actvity during session 2.  No more than 120 minutes should be allocated to the Scavenger Hunt. 

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* Require students to pair up with someone who is not in their school. Create a community within the class!
* Print copies of the [clues worksheet](clues.md) before class.
* Decide how you are going to keep score. Most teams use a whiteboard.
* Have prizes ready. Company swag (stickers!!) is a fan-favorite.

##Project Extensions
There are plenty of challenges for this project, so students finishing early should not be an issue. It is likely no group will complete all the tasks.
