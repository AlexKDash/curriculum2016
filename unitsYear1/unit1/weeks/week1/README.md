##Part 1 (45 minutes)
In this lesson the students will have their first introduction to HTML. They will be asked to create their first website using the IDE [Popcode](https://popcode.org). The Student will learn the basic structure of a webpage.

##Part 2 (45 minutes)
In this lesson the students will again use Popcode to create a website. They will also sign up for a GitHub account.


##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* Tags are like parenthesis! They work in pairs. (each one has a friend)
* Use the "view in seperate page"" feature in Popcode to show students they have made a live website.
