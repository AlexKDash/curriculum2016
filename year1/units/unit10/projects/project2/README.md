#Unit 9: Project 2 || Calcultor


##Scope
This project asks the students to create a calculator with basic functionality. This project provides the student with a lot of solution code. Students will need only to create functions for each calculator action. 

##Estimated Completion Time
This project should take 45 minutes to complete. Project may take less or more time depending on students' needs.  

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* CStudents should not touch calculator.js... they must only add code to guts.js
* Stduents have not yet been taught how to create each action. The following unit covers random. This project can be revisited in a couple weeks if the teacher decides they would like to approach it in this way.
